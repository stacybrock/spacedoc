# spacedoc

A super-simple git-backed wiki

**Current status:** Pre-alpha, like a bone being thrown by an ancient hominid in the shadow of a monolith.

## Configuration

The wiki configuration file should be placed in: `instance/config.cfg`

A fully documented example config can be found at `instance/config.cfg-dist`.
